# Sales Receipt Automation

This is an automation of a sales receipt to validate its fields, prices, and counts.

## Getting Started

To get started, update node to the latest version (https://nodejs.dev/download/). I used v15.12. Run `npm i cypress` to install Cypress. If this is your first time running Cypress, run `npx cypress verify` to verify Cypress on your machine. Then run `./node_modules/.bin/cypress open` to launch the Cypress GUI. From there, select `test.js` to see the tests run.
